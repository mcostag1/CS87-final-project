An incomplete roadmap to the zipper source.  Work in progress.


clip.c
------
Clips one mesh against another after thickening the boundaries.


close_match.c
-------------
Performs iterative Besl matching and rigid transformation, using the
matches obtained from match_parallel.c.  May drag other meshes along
(haven't tried this yet).


closest.c
---------
Computes the best non-rigid transformation between two matched sets of
points.


consensus.c
-----------
Performs consensus step so that all meshes contribute to final mesh.


cursor.c
--------
Handles the cursor shapes.


cyfile.c
--------
File I/O for Cyberware format range images.


draw.c
------
Handles all drawing of meshes into a GL window.


edges.c
-------
Finds all edges of a mesh and consolidates them into edge loops.


event.c
-------
Event handler.


fill.c
------
Fills edge loops (holes) in a mesh.


help.c
------
Simple online help.


intersect.c
-----------
???


invert.c
--------
Performs inversion of matrices


match_parallel.c
----------------
Finds best pairwise matches of one mesh against another.  Results are
used in Besl alignmentin close_match.c.


matrix.c
--------
Matrix operations.


mesh.c
------
Turns a range grid into a mesh at the desired resolution level.


myalloc.c
---------
Does memory allocation.


meshops.c
----------
Does hole filling, bow fixing, sliver triangle removal, vertex
removal...


polyfile.c
----------
Old polygon format.  Also, a routine for guessing mesh resolution.
