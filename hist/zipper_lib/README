Changes to Zipper
-----------------
We have made some changes to the zipper program since the release of
version 1.0.  See the CHANGES file for details.


Zipper Compilation and Execution
--------------------------------

This file documents compiling and running "zipper", a program for
combining multiple range images to form a polygon model.

A tutorial for zipper can be found in Zipper.doc.

Execution
---------

Before you can execute the zipper program you will need to set the
environment variable to use Tcl and Tk.  We will assume that you have 
placed all of the zipper files in a directory with a full path of 
/usr/people/yourname/zipper.  Then this environment variable need to be set:

  setenv ZIPPER_DIR /usr/people/yourname/zipper

If you do not have a Tcl/Tk environment installed, then you will have
to set two more environment variables:

  setenv TCL_LIBRARY /usr/people/yourname/zipper/tcl_and_tk
  setenv TK_LIBRARY /usr/people/yourname/zipper/tcl_and_tk

After completing the above, zipper should execute without trouble.

Compilation
-----------

Zipper was written to run on Silicon Graphics workstations.  It makes use of
the old-style GL graphics library, so it currently can ONLY run on SGI's.
Eventually somebody should port it to Open GL, but don't hold your breath.
Zipper also makes use of the Tcl command interpreter and the Tk widget
toolkit, both written by John Ousterhout of Berkeley.  You will need to
install Tcl and Tk on your machine in order to compile zipper from scratch.

You probably do not need to compile zipper from scratch if you have an
ordinary SGI workstation.  The source is provided primarily for those people
wanting to modify the program.  If you just want to run the program as-is, the
directions above under "Execution" should be enough.

The particular versions of Tcl and Tk that zipper uses are Tcl 7.3 and Tk 3.6.
These releases are available from several anonymous FTP sites, including:

  ftp.cs.berkeley.edu in /ucb/tcl
  harbor.ecn.purdue.edu in /pub/tcl

You can also find information about it on the World Wide Web:

  http://www.sco.com/IXI/of_interest/tcl/Tcl.html
  http://web.cs.ualberta.ca/~wade/Auto/Tcl.html

Once you have installed Tk and Tcl, you will need to edit "makefile" in your
zipper source directory and set the variables TCL_LIB and TCL_INCLUDE to the
appropriate directories on your machine.

In addition, you may need to recompile the provided libraries (for
example, if you are using IRIX 4.x or less).  The source for the ply
library (libply.a) for reading and writing ply polygon files can be
obtained via anonymous FTP from:

   graphics.stanford.edu in pub/zippack

The source for the Meschach Library (libmeschach.a) which provides
zipper with the numerical methods necessary for alignment can be
obtained from:

   netlib.org in c/meschach


After the above steps are taken, zipper should compile straight from the
makefile.
